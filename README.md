# MinimaxAlphaBeta
Minimax with alpha beta pruning to select best first hero for the Radiant team in Dota 2, all test cases finish in under 3 minutes



Description: Given the current rosters and pool, choose the next hero that eventually maximizes
your advantage against your opponent. You are the captain of the Radiant in a DotA 2 tournament. You
and your opponent must choose from the same pool of N heroes, and each hero can only be picked once.
You will take turns choosing (Radiant → Dire → Radiant → ... → Dire),2 and you each must choose on
your turn (i.e., no skipping your turn). You will choose first. The process ends after your team and your
opponent team both have exactly 5 heroes (i.e., 10 distinct heroes are picked in total).
